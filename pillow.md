The **Python Imaging Library (PIL)** is a powerful library for image processing in Python. However, PIL does not support Python 3, so a fork named Pillow was created to provide the same functionality with support for Python 3

## Installation

To install Pillow, you can use pip:

    pip install pillow

This command will install the latest version of Pillow, which includes extensive file format support and powerful image processing capabilities
